# 4) Factorial Calculation (3 ქულა)
# Create a program that receives a non-negative integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. By definition, the factorial of 0 is 1.
# Examples:
# 5 --> 120
# 0 --> 1

def factorial(num):
    result = 1

    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        result *= i

    return result

print(factorial(5))
